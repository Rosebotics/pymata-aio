  Exp7_2_DriveDistance -- RedBot Experiment 7.2

  In an earlier experiment, we used a combination of speed and time to
  drive a certain distance. Using the encoders, we can me much more accurate.
  In this example, we will show you how to setup your robot to drive a certain
  distance regardless of the motorPower.

  This sketch was written by SparkFun Electronics, with lots of help from
  the Arduino community. This code is completely free for any use.
