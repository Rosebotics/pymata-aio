  Exp8_1_AccelerometerRead -- RedBot Experiment 8.1

  Measuring speed, velocity, and acceleration are all key
  components to robotics. This first experiment will introduce
  you to using the Accelerometer sensor on the RedBot.

  Hardware setup:
  You'll need to attach the RedBot Accelerometer board to hader on the upper
  right side of the mainboard. See the manual for details on how to do this.

  This sketch was written by SparkFun Electronics, with lots of help from
  the Arduino community. This code is completely free for any use.

  This experiment was inspired by Paul Kassebaum at Mathworks, who made
  one of the very first non-SparkFun demo projects and brought it to the
  2013 Open Hardware Summit in Boston. Thanks Paul!
